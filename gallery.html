			<b>Kardia Proxim(Front)</b><br />
			<i>Plywood, Walnut, infrared Sensor, Laptop, Bass Amplifier</i><br />
			<p class="highslide">An installation in which one's proximity perturbs the balance of a fragile item.  The sensor is programmed to detect proximal movement and, as a function of the distance between the observer and the piece, increases or decreases the amount of bass amplification and vibration.  As a result, the movements of the observers will determine if the fragile item remains atop the piece or shatters..</p>

			<b>Equanimity(Front)</b><br />
			<i>CNC, MDF, Metal, Fabric, Speakers, High Density Foam</i>
			<p>This installation incorporates smell, sound and taste, the result of which is an enveloping state of sensory stimulation.  The chairs are crafted in style of a coffee cup and are large enough to seat one adult.  Hidden speakers, installed within the chairs, play dulcet melodies composed from a combination of recorded coffee sounds.  The environment offers a chance for the viewer to participate, inviting them to break free from the common apprehension to touch and interact with art.  As a whole, the experience of Equanimity allows the participant to escape the humdrum rhythms of daily life and experience a perceptually rich meditation shaped by the ubiquitous theme of coffee.</p>

			<i>Birch, Microphone, Projector, Laptop, Max/MSP, Speakers, Steel</i>

This installation explores the curious connections between a peacock's plumage and a microphone.</p>
